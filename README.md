INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THE TRAFFIC SIGN APPLICATION
 
The Project Can be accessed using this site: https://trafficsign-183218.appspot.com

Once you enter, you get welcomed by a page called “My Traffic signs application”.

You can add a new latitude AND longitudes and specify the kind of traffic signal present there, it gets updated into the database, by clicking the “FEED TRAFFIC SIGN” button.

In the same way you can search/retrieve the traffic signs by location(i.e latitude/longitude) and the maximum distance from the location the traffic signs are by clicking the “GET TRAFFIC SIGN” button.

The system searches for the closest traffic sign to the distance specified in the query.

The output is shown with a cool image of the traffic signal and it also specifies the distance of the traffic sign from the said location.
